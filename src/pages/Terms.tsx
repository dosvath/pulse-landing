        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Binding Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a legally binding agreement
          between you and PulseDate Technologies Ltd. ("Pulse," "we," "us," or
          "our"), the operator of the Pulse global dating platform and related
          services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing, downloading, or
          using the Service, including by submitting an application or creating
          a Pulse account, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and
          agree to be bound by these Terms, including our{" "}
          <Link to="/privacy" className="underline">
            Privacy Policy
          </Link>
          , which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not accept and
          agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not use the
          Service.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse may update or modify these Terms at any time at its sole
          discretion. We will provide notice of material changes (for example,
          by posting the updated Terms with a new Effective Date at the top, or
          by other reasonable means). Continued use of the Service after an
          update constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your
          responsibility to review these Terms periodically. If you do not agree
          to any updated Terms, you should stop using the Service and, if
          applicable, cancel your membership.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          To register for and use Pulse, you must meet all of the following
          eligibility requirements:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old
            (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher). The
            Service is intended solely for adults. Under no circumstances may
            anyone under 18 use or access Pulse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Capacity:</strong> You must have the right, authority,
            and capacity to enter into this agreement and to abide by all of its
            terms. By using Pulse, you represent and warrant that you are
            legally qualified to enter a binding contract with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Criminal or Sex Offender History:</strong> By using
            Pulse, you represent and warrant that you have never been convicted
            of a felony and are not required to register as a sex offender with
            any governmental registry. You also represent that you have not been
            convicted of any crime involving violence, sexual misconduct, or
            harassment. Pulse reserves the right to conduct criminal background
            checks, at any time and to the extent permitted by law, to confirm
            compliance with this requirement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Previous Bans:</strong> You may not use the Service if you
            have been previously removed, banned, or had your account terminated
            by Pulse, unless you have Pulse’s express written permission to
            create a new account. Pulse may also refuse access if you have been
            banned from similar dating platforms for misconduct.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Truthful Information:</strong> All information you provide
            to Pulse must be true, current, and complete. This includes
            information provided during sign-up, profile creation, and any
            identity verification process. You agree not to misrepresent your
            identity, age, marital status, profession, or any other facts.
            Impersonation of any person or entity is strictly forbidden.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographic Restrictions:</strong> The Service is global, but
            use of Pulse is void where prohibited by law. You are responsible
            for ensuring that using Pulse complies with all laws and regulations
            applicable to you (including, for example, export control laws or
            local age restrictions).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you do not meet all of these criteria, you must not access or use
          Pulse. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet
          all eligibility requirements and that you will maintain compliance
          with these Terms. Pulse may suspend or terminate your account if we
          discover or suspect that you do not meet the eligibility requirements.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
          3. Account Registration and Verification
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Account Creation</h3>
        <p>
          In order to use Pulse’s features, you will need to create an account
          and submit an application for membership. You must provide a valid
          email address (or phone number, if required), and set a secure
          password, along with other requested information. You agree to keep
          your login credentials confidential and not share them with anyone.
          You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
          If you believe someone has accessed your account without permission,
          notify us immediately.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Mandatory Face Verification (Live Video)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pulse is a selective community that values authenticity and safety. As
          part of the registration process, and before your account is approved,
          you are required to complete a face verification step. This
          verification will typically involve capturing your live image or a
          short real-time video (a "video selfie") through the app or website.
          The purpose is to confirm that your appearance matches your profile
          photos and to ensure you are a real person (not a bot or using someone
          else’s pictures). By registering, you agree to cooperate with this
          verification process. Pulse (or its authorized third-party service
          provider) will use facial recognition technology and/or human review
          of the video to verify your identity. The video you submit is used
          solely for verification and will be processed in accordance with our
          <Link to="/privacy" className="underline">
            Privacy Policy
          </Link>
          . If you fail the face verification, refuse to complete it, or if the
          results are inconclusive or suspicious, Pulse may reject your
          application or require additional verification steps. We may also
          require reverification at any time during your membership, especially
          if suspicious activity is detected on your account. Not providing a
          verification video upon request, or failing verification at any time,
          may result in suspension or termination of your account.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Human Review of Applications (Selective Admission)
        </h3>
        <p>
          All new membership applications on Pulse undergo human moderation and
          review by Pulse’s team. Pulse is a curated dating platform – this
          means we selectively approve memberships in order to maintain
          community quality and safety. Submission of an application does not
          guarantee acceptance. Our review team will evaluate your profile
          information, photos, verification results, and any other factors we
          deem relevant to decide whether you are granted membership. Pulse
          reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to approve or deny any
          application for any reason or no reason. We may reject applicants who
          do not meet our community standards, who provide insufficient or
          questionable information, or for any other reason we deem appropriate.
          We are under no obligation to provide an explanation for any
          membership decision. By applying, you acknowledge that Pulse’s
          selection criteria are inherently subjective and you have no guarantee
          or entitlement to membership.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Selective Membership and Reservation of Rights
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pulse may limit the number of active members and may enforce quality
          standards (such as activity level, profile completeness, etiquette,
          etc.). We reserve the right to suspend or remove inactive accounts or
          accounts that do not meet ongoing standards, even after initial
          approval. Approval as a member at one time does not guarantee
          continued membership; all use remains subject to compliance with these
          Terms and any community guidelines.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Accuracy of Information; Further Checks
        </h3>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that all information and content you provide
          during sign-up and throughout your use of Pulse is accurate, truthful,
          and up-to-date. Pulse relies on this information for vetting
          applicants. We reserve the right to request additional information or
          documentation from you at any point (for example, identification
          documents, proof of age, or social media links) to verify your
          identity or background as a condition of initial or continued
          membership. You authorize Pulse to research and verify any facts or
          representations you provide, including performing checks of publicly
          available information or social media, consistent with applicable law.
          If any information you provided is discovered to be false, misleading,
          or incomplete, Pulse may immediately deny your application or revoke
          your membership and may take legal action if appropriate (for example,
          for fraudulent misrepresentation).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Membership and Fees</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Paid Membership Requirement</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse operates on a paid membership model. While browsing certain
          limited parts of the Service (such as viewing a promotional landing
          page or perhaps basic profile previews) may be free, full access to
          the Service – including the ability to initiate or send messages and
          interact with other users – is available only to approved Members who
          purchase the required membership. Pulse offers a single membership
          tier ("Pulse Membership") which unlocks the full features of the
          dating platform.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Membership Fees and Billing</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse offers Membership access through either a one-time payment or a
          subscription-based model, depending on the option selected at the time
          of purchase. One-time purchases grant access to the platform’s
          features for a defined duration or scope, with payment charged in full
          and upfront. Subscription-based memberships, where available, are
          billed in advance and may auto-renew on a recurring basis (e.g.,
          monthly or annually) until cancelled. By subscribing, you authorize
          Pulse (or our third-party payment processor or app store, as
          applicable) to charge the advertised membership fee in accordance with
          the billing terms presented at checkout. Unless otherwise stated,
          subscriptions will auto-renew for successive terms equal in length to
          the initial term, at the then-current rate, until cancelled. You may
          cancel your Pulse Membership at any time through your account settings
          or the platform through which you subscribed. Cancellation takes
          effect at the end of your current paid term — you will retain access
          to membership features until that term expires, and no further charges
          will be made.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">No Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          All membership payments are final. Pulse maintains a strict no-refund
          policy. This means that membership fees (and any other charges) are
          non-refundable, including in cases where you terminate your account
          early or if your account is terminated by Pulse for violating these
          Terms. We will not provide refunds or credits for any unused time or
          features of your membership, except where required by applicable law
          or explicitly stated otherwise in these Terms. (For example, if a
          refund is required by a specific jurisdiction’s consumer protection
          laws or if we choose to make an exception in our sole discretion, we
          will of course comply with the law.) Aside from such rare cases, by
          purchasing a Pulse membership you acknowledge and agree that you are
          not entitled to a refund of any kind. Please be sure you want to
          subscribe before you complete any payment.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Payment Disputes</h3>
        <p>
          If a payment made for Pulse Membership is disputed, reversed, or
          charged back (e.g., through your bank, credit card provider, or app
          store), Pulse reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate
          your account while the issue is under review. To avoid interruption of
          access, users are encouraged to contact Pulse support to resolve
          billing concerns before initiating a dispute through their payment
          provider.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Pricing and Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse reserves the right to change the price and terms of the Pulse
          Membership fees from time to time. We may add new membership options,
          adjust prices, or offer limited-time promotions or discounts. If the
          pricing for your membership is due to change, we will endeavor to
          provide advance notice (for example, by email or in-app notification).
          If you do not agree to a price or subscription change, you must cancel
          your membership before the next billing date. If you continue to use
          the Service after the price change takes effect, you are deemed to
          accept the new price and charges will be made accordingly. All prices
          are in the currency specified at purchase and inclusive/exclusive of
          applicable taxes as required by law (VAT, sales tax, etc. will be
          indicated if applicable). You are responsible for any internet or
          mobile charges you incur in accessing the Service.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Payment Processors and App Store Purchases
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pulse uses third-party payment processors to handle membership
          transactions (e.g., credit card gateways). The processing of payments
          is subject to the terms and privacy policies of those third-party
          platforms. Pulse is not responsible for errors by payment processors.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Account Security for Payments</h3>
        <p>
          You must provide current, complete, and accurate billing information.
          If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may
          collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms, and/or suspend or
          terminate your membership for non-payment. You agree that for any
          credit/debit card transactions, we may store your card information for
          future billing (in accordance with our Privacy Policy and industry
          standards). If you dispute any charge, you agree to contact Pulse
          first and attempt to resolve the issue. You agree not to initiate any
          chargeback without first giving Pulse the opportunity to resolve your
          concern. We reserve the right to contest chargebacks and take
          collection action for unpaid fees.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
          5. User Conduct and Prohibited Activities
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to maintaining a respectful, safe, and genuine
          community on Pulse. By using the Service, you agree to abide by the
          following user conduct standards and not engage in any of the
          prohibited activities described below. Violation of these conduct
          standards is grounds for immediate termination or suspension of your
          account, at Pulse’s sole discretion, and may also expose you to legal
          consequences.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          5.1. Compliance with Laws and Terms

          regulations, as well as these Terms and any additional policies or

          safety tips provided within the app). You must not use the Service for
          any illegal or unauthorized purpose.

          Pulse is for individual, personal dating use only. You will not use
          the Service to run any business, engage in advertising or promotional

          <li>
            <strong>Sexual Harassment:</strong> Unwanted sexual advances or
            sexually explicit messages sent without consent are prohibited.
            Respect others’ boundaries. If someone indicates they are not
            interested or asks you to stop messaging them, you must cease
            contact.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">5.5. Prohibited Content</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for all content you upload, post, or send via
          Pulse (including profile information, photos, audio/video, and
          messages). You agree that you will not upload, display, or transmit
          any content (including in your profile or in communications with
          others) that:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Is Obscene or Pornographic:</strong> Contains nudity
            (especially genitalia or pornographic sexual acts), sexually
            explicit material, or is otherwise lewd or obscene.
            (Non-pornographic profile photos in swimsuits or similar attire may
            be acceptable, but use common sense and Pulse’s guidelines—no
            sexually explicit images or media.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Involves Minors:</strong> Includes images or information of
            any minor (under 18), whether alone or with an adult. Pulse has zero
            tolerance for any content that exploits or endangers children. You
            must not post any content depicting minors, and you must not use the
            Service to seek minors in any way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Violent or Gore:</strong> Contains graphic violence, gore,
            or images of weapons meant in a threatening manner. Displaying guns
            or other weapons in a profile picture or sending violent imagery to
            others is prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Offensive or Hateful:</strong> Contains defamatory,
            discriminatory, or otherwise offensive material, including slurs or
            insults targeting a protected group or any other person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promotes Illegal or Harmful Activities:</strong> Encourages
            or facilitates any illegal activity, such as drug use, terrorism,
            buying/selling illegal weapons or substances, or any form of
            exploitation or human trafficking. You must not use Pulse to engage
            in or promote prostitution, escort services, or transactional sexual
            activities. (Offering money or goods in exchange for romantic/sexual
            favors, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited on Pulse.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Private or Proprietary Information of Others:</strong>{" "}
            Contains personal data or images of any person other than you
            without that person’s consent. This includes posting someone else’s
            photograph, personal contact information (phone numbers, addresses,
            email, social media handles), or sensitive documents. Sharing
            private texts or messages from someone without their permission is
            also prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spam and Malware:</strong> Constitutes unsolicited
            advertising or spam (such as mass messaging users with commercial
            offers, pyramid schemes, or links to other sites). Also, you must
            not upload any software or files that contain viruses, malware,
            ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, or any other code
            intended to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of the
            Service or any user’s device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infringes Rights:</strong> Violates the intellectual
            property rights or other rights of any person or entity. This
            includes content that you do not have the right to share under law
            or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as insider
            information, proprietary and confidential information). Do not
            upload content that infringes copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
            privacy rights, or publicity rights of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disruptive or Misleading:</strong> Includes deceptive images
            or audio (e.g., deepfakes) that could mislead others, or any
            material that misrepresents the source. Also, content that could be
            reasonably deemed as phishing or attempting to defraud others is
            forbidden.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pulse reserves the right to remove or blur any photo or content that
          violates these standards or is otherwise inappropriate, and may do so
          without warning.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">5.6. Use of the Service</h3>
        <p>In using Pulse, you agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            Use the Service in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden,
            or impair the Service or interfere with any other person’s use and
            enjoyment of Pulse. This includes not engaging in denial-of-service
            attacks, spamming, or any other activity that might disrupt the
            Service or the servers and networks connected to the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempt to circumvent any security or verification measures employed
            by Pulse. You will not attempt to bypass the face verification or
            other security features, and you will not attempt to access data or
            accounts that you are not authorized to access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrape, crawl, or use any automated means or bots to access or
            collect information from Pulse. The use of any robot, spider, site
            search/retrieval application, or other automated device, process, or
            means to access, retrieve, data-mine, or index any portion of the
            Service or its content is prohibited without our express prior
            written consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any aspect of Pulse, or
            do anything that might reveal source code or bypass or circumvent
            measures employed to prevent or limit access to any content, area,
            or code of the Service (except as otherwise expressly permitted by
            law).
          </li>
          <li>
            Frame or mirror any part of the Service without Pulse’s prior
            written authorization. This means you may not enclose our website or
            interface within another website, or present our content as your
            own.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop or use any third-party applications that interact with Pulse
            or other Members’ content or information without our written
            consent. (This includes any apps, plugins, scripts, or other
            software not provided by Pulse that tries to interact with the
            platform’s features or database.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Solicit passwords or personal identifying information from other
            users for commercial or unlawful purposes. For example, you must not
            ask another user for their credit card details, social security
            number, or other sensitive info through Pulse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Solicit money or financial assistance from other users. You cannot
            use Pulse to beg, ask for money, or run scams (like catfishing for
            money, fraudulent charity requests, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the Service to advertise or sell any goods or services to other
            users, or to transmit junk mail, chain letters, fraudulent schemes,
            or any other form of solicitation that Pulse has not authorized.
            Pulse is not a marketplace; any attempt to conduct business
            transactions (outside of legitimate personal dating arrangements) on
            the platform is forbidden.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collect or harvest information about other members without their
            consent. This includes scraping profiles, collecting usernames or
            user IDs, or using any data obtained from Pulse to abuse or exploit
            any user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Pulse if you are a competitor or in the dating industry for the
            purpose of competing with Pulse, researching our platform, or
            poaching users. Competitors, media, or any third party must not
            create accounts for the purpose of monitoring or analyzing Pulse
            without authorization.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">5.7. Reporting and Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse strives to enforce these conduct standards vigorously but
          fairly. We encourage users to report any behavior or content that
          violates these Terms or makes them uncomfortable. You can report users
          within the app or contact us at the provided contact information.
          Enforcement of these rules is at Pulse’s sole discretion. We may warn,
          suspend, or terminate any member’s account if we believe these rules
          have been violated. However, the absence of action by Pulse on one
          occasion does not waive our right to enforce the rules in the future.
          You understand that Pulse has the right (but not the obligation) to
          monitor interactions and content on the Service and to remove any
          content or users that violate these Terms or applicable law.

          6. User Content and Intellectual Property Rights
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">6.1. Your Content</h3>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of any and all content and information you
          provide or upload to Pulse (such as your profile photos, biography,
          descriptions, messages you send, and any other material you submit,
          collectively, "User Content"). However, by providing or posting User
          Content on Pulse, you grant Pulse a worldwide, perpetual,
          transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to host, store,
          use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, translate,
          distribute, and create derivative works from your User Content. This
          license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing,
          providing, promoting, and improving the Service, and researching and
          developing new ones. For example, this license allows us to display
          your profile to other members, to format your content for display, to
          advertise and promote the Service (which may include screenshots of
          the app that show your public content), and to make backups of content
          in case of data loss. Pulse will not use your content for any other
          purpose not related to providing the Service without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the
          User Content you upload, and that our use of your content as permitted
          by this Agreement will not infringe or violate the rights of any third
          party. Do not upload or share content you do not own or are not
          authorized to share. You agree that we may monitor and remove or
          delete any User Content that, in our sole judgment, violates these
          Terms or could harm the reputation or integrity of Pulse or the
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can delete your User Content at any time by removing it from the
          Service or deleting your account. However, you acknowledge that
          removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period
          of time (but will not be available to other users), and Pulse may
          retain certain content as required by law or for legitimate business
          purposes. Also, content that you have shared with other users (for
          example, messages you sent) may continue to be stored or displayed in
          those users’ message inboxes or content feeds, and Pulse is not able
          to delete those copies once they are delivered. The license you grant
          to us for your content ends when you delete the content from our
          Service or terminate your account, except that you understand any such
          deletion by us will not apply to content that has already been shared
          with others or used publicly with your permission (for example, if
          your profile photo was featured in an official Pulse advertisement,
          that advertisement may continue to be used until we decide to take it
          down).

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          6.2. Pulse’s Content and Proprietary Rights
        </h3>
        <p>
          All content on the Service other than User Content, including without
          limitation the text, graphics, images, logos, button icons, software
          code, design, compilations, and Pulse’s trademarks and logos (the
          "Pulse Content"), is owned by or licensed to Pulse and is protected by
          copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual
          property or proprietary rights laws. All right, title and interest in
          and to the Service and Pulse Content remain with PulseDate
          Technologies Ltd. and its licensors. We grant you a limited,
          revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use
          the Pulse Content for your personal, non-commercial use in accordance
          with these Terms. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you
          use and enjoy the Service’s features as intended by Pulse. No rights
          are granted to you other than the limited license described. You may
          not copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
          retransmit, exploit, or create derivative works from any of the Pulse
          Content, in whole or in part, except as expressly permitted by Pulse
          in writing. Any unauthorized use of Pulse’s intellectual property or
          the Service’s content is strictly prohibited and may result in legal
          action and termination of the license.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">6.3. Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          If you chosen to provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback to Pulse
          about our Service ("Feedback"), you agree that Pulse can use and share
          such Feedback for any purpose without compensating you. You hereby
          grant Pulse a perpetual, sublicensable, transferable license to use
          and incorporate any Feedback you provide into the Service or other
          products or services.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">6.4. DMCA and Copyright Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects
          users to do the same. If you believe any content on Pulse infringes
          your copyright or other intellectual property rights, please notify us
          in writing with detailed information (e.g., a DMCA takedown notice if
          applicable) so that we can investigate and remove the infringing
          material if appropriate. We may terminate the accounts of repeat
          infringers in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
          (DMCA) or similar laws.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. Term and Termination</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Term of Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms remain in full force and effect while you access or use
          the Service and/or maintain a Pulse account. This Agreement will
          continue to apply to you until either you or Pulse terminates your
          account as described below. All provisions of these Terms which by
          their nature should survive termination (including, without
          limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
          limitations of liability, dispute resolution and arbitration
          agreements) will survive termination.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Your Right to Terminate</h3>
        <p>
          You may terminate your Pulse membership and account at any time and
          for any reason. You can do this by following the instructions in the
          Service (for example, an account “Deactivate” or “Delete Account”
          option in settings) or by sending a written notice of termination to
          Pulse’s customer support (through the contact information provided in
          these Terms or on our website). If you terminate your account, you
          will no longer have access to your profile or any features of the
          Service. Because Pulse does not offer refunds, if you choose to
          terminate your account before the end of your paid membership term,
          you will not receive any refund for the remaining unused period (see
          Section 4 above on No Refund Policy). After termination, Pulse may
          still retain certain information associated with your account for a
          period of time, as described in our Privacy Policy (for legal
          compliance, prevention of fraud, record-keeping, or other legitimate
          purposes).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Our Right to Terminate or Suspend
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pulse may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your account
          or membership at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.
          This includes, but is not limited to, situations where: (a) you have
          violated these Terms or any policies incorporated herein; (b) we
          believe you have misused the Service or behaved in a way that is
          inappropriate, illegal, or that could bring harm or liability to Pulse
          or our users; (c) you have engaged in conduct on or off the platform
          that we deem harmful to the safety or well-being of the community or
          the public (even if not specifically within the Service); (d) required
          by law enforcement or other government agencies; or (e) for no reason
          at all (Pulse reserves the right to remove anyone from the platform at
          its sole discretion, even if not for a specific breach). We are not
          required to disclose the exact reason for suspension or termination in
          every case, though generally we aim to inform you if your account is
          terminated due to a violation.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Effect of Termination by Pulse</h3>
        <p>
          If your account is terminated or suspended by us, you agree to
          immediately cease all use of the Service. You will lose access to any
          data or content associated with your account (although users you
          interacted with may still see messages or content you previously sent
          them). If your account is terminated due to a violation of these Terms
          or improper conduct, you will not be entitled to any refund of any
          membership fees or purchases you have made (in fact, you forfeit any
          remaining prepaid period). Pulse may also prohibit you from creating a
          new account or accessing the Service in the future. In serious cases,
          we may also report information to law enforcement if your conduct
          violates law or threatens others.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          No New Accounts After Termination
        </h3>
        <p>
          If your account has been terminated by Pulse (for any reason), you are
          not allowed to create a new account without our explicit permission.
          If you attempt to circumvent a ban or termination by creating a new
          account, we reserve the right to terminate that new account and take
          appropriate further action (including legal action or contacting
          authorities, if warranted).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Account Deactivation vs. Deletion
        </h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, you may choose to "deactivate" your account
          (temporarily hiding your profile) instead of fully deleting it. The
          Terms continue to apply to you during any deactivation period. Pulse
          may also deactivate (rather than permanently delete) accounts that
          violate policies or that we suspect are involved in prohibited
          behavior, pending investigation. We reserve the right to maintain data
          from deactivated or closed accounts as necessary to comply with legal
          obligations, prevent fraud, or enforce our rights.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Survival of Terms</h3>
        <p>
          After your relationship with Pulse ends (by any termination or
          cancellation of your account), most provisions of these Terms will
          continue to operate. In particular, the sections relating to No
          Refunds, User Content License (to the extent of rights needed to
          enforce any post-termination issues), Disclaimers, Limitation of
          Liability, Indemnification, Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, Governing
          Law, and Miscellaneous shall survive termination.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">8. Disclaimers of Warranties</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Use at Your Own Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse provides the Service on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.
          Your use of the Service and any content on the Service is at your sole
          risk. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Pulse expressly

          non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing
          or usage of trade. Pulse does not guarantee that the Service will meet
          your expectations or requirements, or that the results of using the
          Service will be satisfactory or secure.

          Pulse is a platform to facilitate connections among users, but we make
          no guarantees, express or implied, about your compatibility with or

          Service Availability and Accuracy
        </h3>
        <p>
          We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely,
          secure, or error-free. Pulse does not warrant that any errors or
          defects in the Service will be corrected. We cannot guarantee the
          continued operation of certain features or the overall system.
          Temporary outages may occur, and features may be modified or
          discontinued. Additionally, while we strive to keep the Service
          bug-free and secure, Pulse does not warrant that the Service is free
          of viruses or other harmful components. You are responsible for
          implementing appropriate security measures (like anti-virus, not
          downloading suspicious content, etc.) on your own devices.

        <p>
          Pulse is not responsible for the conduct of any user or for any
          content posted by users. You understand that Pulse does not do
          traditional background checks (aside from the verification processes
          described) or criminal record checks on users at the time of account
          creation (beyond any representations they make and our limited
          screening). We do not guarantee the authenticity, identity, or
          trustworthiness of any user you may interact with. You should exercise
          appropriate caution in all interactions with others, especially if you
          decide to communicate outside the Service or meet in person. Pulse
          makes no representations or warranties as to the conduct, intentions,
          or compatibility of users you encounter. We do not vet every detail of
          user-provided information, and profiles or statements may be
          inaccurate, falsified, or deceptive. Use common sense when interacting
          with others: do not share sensitive personal information too quickly,
          meet in public places for initial meetings, tell a friend or family
          member your plans, and be careful of possible scams.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          No Fiduciary Duty; No Professional Advice
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pulse is not in the business of providing professional advice (legal,
          medical, psychological, or otherwise). Any advice or information
          (whether oral or written) obtained by you from Pulse or through the
          Service shall not create any warranty not expressly stated in these
          Terms, and you should not rely on it as professional advice. You are
          solely responsible for your interactions and decisions.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Third-Party Links or Services</h3>
        <p>
          The Service may contain advertisements or promotions offered by third
          parties and links to other websites or resources. Pulse does not
          warrant or endorse any third-party offers, and we are not responsible
          for the availability, contents, products, services, or any aspect of
          third-party websites or resources. If you access any third-party
          content or services from Pulse, you do so at your own risk and subject

        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">No Warranty</h3>
        <p>
          To summarize, Pulse makes no warranties or representations of any kind
          about the accuracy or completeness of the Service’s content (including
          user profiles), the Service itself, or the content of any sites linked
          to the Service. Pulse disclaims any liability or responsibility for
          any errors or omissions in the Service, any technical issues, or any
          damage to your device or loss of data that may result from using the
          Service. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty exclusions,
          so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such cases,
          any implied warranties are limited to the minimum scope and duration
          permitted by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Broad Limitation</h3>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Pulse, its
          parent company, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors,
          employees, agents, partners, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any
          indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive
          damages, or for any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, use, or
          other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to your access to
          or use of (or inability to use) the Service, whether based on
          warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any other
          legal theory, and even if Pulse has been advised of the possibility of
          such damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          This limitation of liability includes, without limitation, any damages
          arising from: (a) your communication or meetings with other users (or
          persons you meet through Pulse) – for example, if you have a bad
          experience, dispute, or any harm comes to you through a meeting
          arranged via Pulse, Pulse will not be liable for those damages; (b)
          use of or reliance on any content (including user profiles,
          information, or advice) obtained through the Service – if you rely on
          something you read on Pulse or a message from another user to your
          detriment, we are not liable; (c) unauthorized access to or alteration
          of your transmissions or data – e.g., if a hacker breaks in or if your
          data or messages are intercepted; (d) the actions or statements of
          third parties on the Service – such as if another user defames you or
          misuses your content; or (e) any other matter relating to the Service.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Cap on Liability</h3>
        <p>
          To the extent that any liability is not legally excludable, the total
          cumulative liability of Pulse and our affiliates, and our and their
          officers, employees, agents, and partners, to you or any third party,
          for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use
          of the Service, regardless of the form of the action, will at all
          times be limited to the amount you have paid to Pulse for the Service
          in the last twelve (12) months, if any, or one hundred Euros (€100),
          whichever is greater. If you have not made any payment to Pulse in the
          last 12 months, Pulse’s total liability to you for all damages shall
          not exceed €100 (or the equivalent in your local currency).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
          damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In
          such cases, Pulse’s liability will be limited to the minimum extent
          permitted by applicable law. Additionally, the above limitations shall
          not apply to liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or
          personal injury/death where such liability cannot be limited by law.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Release</h3>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that Pulse is a platform and not responsible for the
          acts or omissions of any third party (including other users). You
          agree not to hold Pulse liable for any claims, demands, and damages
          (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and
          unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you
          have with another user or a third party. If you are a California
          resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A
          general release does not extend to claims that the creditor does not
          know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing
          the release, which if known by him or her must have materially
          affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">10. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PulseDate
          Technologies Ltd. (Pulse), its parent, affiliates, and their
          respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and partners
          (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
          complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and
          expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or
          relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Service,
          including any content you contribute or actions you take; (b) your
          breach of these Terms or of any representation or warranty provided by
          you herein; (c) your violation of any applicable law or regulation or
          of any rights of any third party (including intellectual property
          rights, privacy, or publicity rights); and/or (d) any
          misrepresentation made by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulse reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive
          defense and control of any matter for which you are required to
          indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate fully in the defense of any
          such matter. You shall not settle any such claim nor enter into any
          agreement that affects the rights of any Indemnified Party without
          Pulse’s prior written approval. We will use reasonable efforts to
          notify you of any such claim or demand that is subject to your
          indemnification obligation upon becoming aware of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This indemnity obligation will survive the termination or expiration
          of your relationship with Pulse and use of the Service.

          11. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
        </h2>
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. It requires you to arbitrate
          disputes with Pulse and limits the manner in which you can seek relief
          from us, unless you opt out as provided below. By agreeing to these
          Terms, you understand and agree that all disputes between you and
          Pulse will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual
          basis, and that you waive the right to a trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          11.1. Informal Resolution Preferred
        </h3>
        <p>
          We encourage you to contact Pulse first in the event of any dispute or
          issue (via our customer support or legal contact address) so that we
          can attempt to resolve your concerns informally. Most user concerns
          can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by reaching out
          to us. Therefore, before initiating arbitration, you agree to try to
          resolve the dispute informally by contacting us with a brief written
          description of your dispute and your contact information. Pulse will
          reply within a reasonable time with an attempt to resolve the issue.
          If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days after notice, either you
          or Pulse may then proceed to initiate arbitration as outlined below.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">11.2. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
        <p>
          Except for the exceptions stated below, you and Pulse agree that any
          dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your
          relationship with Pulse, the use of the Service, or these Terms
          (including disputes about the validity, enforceability, or
          interpretation of any provision of these Terms) shall be finally
          resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court. This includes
          claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or
          any other legal theory. The arbitrator, and not any court, shall have
          exclusive authority to resolve all such disputes relating to the
          interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
          agreement to arbitrate, including any claim that all or part of this
          arbitration agreement is void or voidable.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          11.3. Waiver of Class and Collective Actions
        </h3>
        <p>
          All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual basis only. You
          and Pulse waive the right to join or consolidate claims in arbitration
          with others or to arbitrate any claim as a representative or member of
          a class or in a private attorney general capacity. The arbitrator
          shall have no authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective, or
          representative action. By entering this agreement, you are giving up
          the ability to participate in any class or collective action against
          Pulse.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">11.4. Arbitration Procedures</h3>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be administered by a neutral arbitration
          institution to be agreed upon by you and Pulse. If you and Pulse
          cannot agree on an arbitrator or arbitration institution, the
          arbitration will be conducted under the auspices of the International
          Chamber of Commerce (ICC) (or, if the ICC refuses to administer, then
          an alternative reputable arbitration provider) under the ICC Rules of
          Arbitration, except as modified by this Section. The seat or legal
          place of arbitration shall be Nicosia, Cyprus, unless otherwise
          required by mandatory law or agreed by both parties. The arbitration
          shall be conducted in the English language, unless you and Pulse agree
          otherwise. A single, neutral arbitrator will be appointed. The
          arbitrator may conduct hearings (if any hearings are deemed necessary)
          by telephone or video conference, and need not require personal
          appearances by the parties, unless the arbitrator determines that an
          in-person hearing is appropriate. The arbitrator’s award shall be
          final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any
          court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will have authority to
          award (or decline to award) the same damages and relief that a court
          can award, except that the arbitrator may not award any relief on
          behalf of a class or anyone other than the individual claimant. The
          arbitrator shall provide a reasoned written decision if requested by
          either party.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">11.5. Arbitration Costs</h3>
        <p>
          Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be
          governed by the rules of the arbitration administrator (for example,
          ICC’s fee schedule), unless otherwise stated in this agreement to
          arbitrate. Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees
          and costs unless applicable law or the arbitration rules provide
          otherwise, or unless the arbitrator awards attorneys’ fees to the
          prevailing party (if, for instance, they determine the claim was
          frivolous or brought in bad faith, the arbitrator may award attorneys
          fees as permitted by law). Pulse will not seek to recover its
          attorney’s fees from you in arbitration unless your claims are
          determined to be frivolous.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          11.6. Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement
        </h3>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the above, the following types of claims or disputes
          do not have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: (a) Small
          Claims – either party may seek to resolve an individual dispute in a
          small claims court if it qualifies and so long as the matter remains
          in that court and on an individual (non-class) basis; (b) Injunctive
          Relief for IP or Unauthorized Use – either party may bring a lawsuit
          solely for injunctive relief (no monetary damages) to stop
          unauthorized use or abuse of the Service, or infringement of
          intellectual property (for example, trademark, trade secret,
          copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration. In
          addition, nothing in this agreement prevents either party from
          contacting or filing a complaint with a government agency.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">11.7. Opt-Out Right</h3>
        <p>
          If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action
          waiver provisions in this Section 11, you must notify us in writing
          within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your written notice
          must include your name, the email address associated with your Pulse
          account, your MOJIBAKI, your physical mailing address, and a clear
          statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement. You
          must send this notice by email to support@pulse-date.com. If you opt
          out of this arbitration agreement, your opt-out will apply only to
          disputes arising after the opt-out and will not affect any previous
          arbitration agreements you have entered into with Pulse. Opting out of
          this arbitration provision will not otherwise affect the coverage of
          these Terms or your ability to use the Service. If you do not opt out
          within the 30-day period, you and Pulse shall be bound by the
          arbitration and class-action waiver terms stated above.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          11.8. Severability of Arbitration Terms
        </h3>
        <p>
          If any portion of this arbitration agreement (other than the class
          action waiver in Section 11.3) is found by a court of competent boreal
          to be unenforceable, that portion shall be severed and the remainder
          of the arbitration agreement shall still be given full effect. If the
          class action waiver (Section 11.3) is found to be unenforceable, then
          the entirety of this arbitration agreement shall be null and void, and
          the dispute may be brought in court (with the class action waiver
          still enforced to the maximum extent allowed). In such case, the
          parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in
          Section 12 (Governing Law) shall govern any lawsuit.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">11.9. Survival</h3>
        <p>
          This arbitration provision will survive the termination of your
          relationship with Pulse.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
          12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms, and any dispute between you and Pulse, whether subject to
          arbitration or not, will be governed by the laws of the Republic of
          Cyprus, without regard to its conflict of law provisions that would
          result in application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. This
          means that the law that will apply to any disputes will be the law of
          Cyprus (subject, where relevant, to certain federal or international
          laws that may preempt Cyprus law, such as specific consumer protection
          regulations that cannot be waived).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">
          Jurisdiction for Non-Arbitrable Claims
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the unlikely event that a dispute is found by a competent court not
          to be subject to the arbitration agreement in Section 11 (either
          because you opted out of arbitration, or the arbitration clause is
          held unenforceable, or you are bringing a claim expressly exempt from
          arbitration as per Section 11.6), then you and Pulse agree that any
          such dispute must be exclusively brought in the courts of Cyprus.
          Specifically, you agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of
          the courts located in the Republic of Cyprus (and any appellate courts
          therefrom) for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
          You and Pulse waive any objections to the venue and jurisdiction of
          those courts (including any defense of inconvenient forum) for
          eligible disputes not arbitrated.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Local Law Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Although the Terms are governed by Cyprus law, we recognize that our
          users come from around the world. Pulse does not seek to limit any
          consumer protection rights that you may have under the mandatory laws
          of your own country of residence. To the extent those laws apply and
          cannot be waived by contract, they will apply notwithstanding the
          choice of Cyprus law.

          or written understandings or agreements between you and Pulse relating
          to your use of the Service. You acknowledge that you have not relied
          on any representation, warranty, or statement not expressly set out in
          these Terms.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary
          rights. No person or entity other than the parties to this Agreement
          (you and Pulse) shall have any right to enforce any term of this
          Agreement.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">No Waiver</h3>
        <p>
          Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
          these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of that right or provision.
          Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if
          in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Pulse. Even
          if we waive any term or provision, the remainder of the Terms shall
          remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Severability</h3>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, void,
          or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction,
          then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and
          shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
          provisions. The parties nevertheless agree that the court or
          arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions
          as reflected in the invalid or unenforceable provision, to the extent
          permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Assignment</h3>
        <p>
          You may not assign or transfer these Terms, or any rights or
          obligations herein, without Pulse’s prior written consent. Any
          attempted assignment by you without consent will be null. Pulse may
          freely assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) as part of
          a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or by
          operation of law or otherwise, and you hereby consent to such
          automatic assignment. These Terms shall inure to the benefit of and be
          binding upon the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Relationship of Parties</h3>
        <p>
          You and Pulse are independent contractors. These Terms (and your use
          of the Service) do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture,
          fiduciary or employment relationship between you and Pulse.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Communications and Notices</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse may communicate with you by electronic means, such as emails or
          in-app notifications, and you consent to receive communications from
          us in an electronic form. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to
          receive communications from Pulse in an electronic form, and (b) agree
          that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and
          other communications that Pulse provides to you electronically satisfy
          any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it
          were in a hardcopy writing. This does not affect your non-waivable
          rights. If we ever need to send you legal notices or service of
          process, we will use the contact information you have provided or any
          other method available under law.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
          resulting from causes outside our reasonable control, such as acts of
          God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, pandemics, acts of civil or
          military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure
          failures, strikes or shortages of transportation, facilities, fuel,
          energy, labor, or materials. In such event, we will use reasonable
          efforts to resume service as soon as practicable.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Headings and Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no
          legal or contractual effect. Words like "including" will be
          interpreted to mean "including without limitation." Any references to
          a singular term include the plural and vice versa, unless context
          requires otherwise.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Language</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are written in English. If these Terms are translated into
          another language and there is a conflict between the English version
          and the translated version, the English version will control (to the
          extent permitted by applicable law).
